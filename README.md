## Conte√∫do:

This repository showcases various optimization techniques applied to common computational geometry problems, such as finding the <b>shortest distance between a pair of points, line intersections, and constructing convex hulls.</b> It includes implementations of algorithms like <b>Divide and Conquer, Graham Scan, Quick Hull, and Convex Hull, all developed using C# within the Unity Engine.</b> The source codes are neatly organized in folders, making it easy to explore and understand each method.

<b>Highlights:</b>

<li>Solutions for common optimization problems in computational geometry</li>
<li>Algorithms implemented in C# for Unity Engine</li>
<li>Organized codebase with clear examples for each technique</li>
<li>Practical for both learning and application in real-world scenarios</li>
<li>Custom implementation of Portal Culling.</li>

Only the source code is available.
Byeeee :)
