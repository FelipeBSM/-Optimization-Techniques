## Conte√∫do:

This repository showcases various optimization techniques applied to common computational geometry problems, such as finding the shortest distance between a pair of points, line intersections, and constructing convex hulls. It includes implementations of algorithms like Divide and Conquer, Graham Scan, Quick Hull, and Convex Hull, all developed using C# within the Unity Engine. The source codes are neatly organized in folders, making it easy to explore and understand each method.

Highlights:

Solutions for common optimization problems in computational geometry
Algorithms implemented in C# for Unity Engine
Organized codebase with clear examples for each technique
Practical for both learning and application in real-world scenarios
Custom implementation of Portal Culling.

Only the source code is available.
Byeeee :)
